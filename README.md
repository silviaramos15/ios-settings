# iOS_Settings Code Adventure Project for Treehouse

# Techdegree F.E.W.D. Slack Challenge Project 04

**These projects are not required to complete your Treehouse Techdegree. They are a supplement to your learning and can be great additions to your portfolio as full projects.**

## **Description** - 
`With this Mockup code challenge, I challenge you to take the iOS Settings as shown in the mockup and recreate it using HTML and CSS! This is a great time to use flexbox or even CSS Grid to structure your settings items.`

## **Getting Started**
When downloading this project you'll find a normal file/folder set up. You will have an `index.html` file as well as an images and css folder. The HTML has a container already set up for you to enter your code in. The css also contains styles to get your started. Please make sure that all of your HTML stays inside the container provided. This is a mobile only design and the container is already set at a fixed width of 320px.

Inside the images folder you will find all the icons needed to recreate this iOS settings design. These are already sized perfectly so that you don't have to do any sizing in the CSS!

Have fun with this challenge!
